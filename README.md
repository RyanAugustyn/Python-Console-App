# Python-Console-App

In this bonus project added the consoleapp.py program, which runs a small program that continually asks users what CRUD functions they want to perform, until they choose to exit. 

The prompt is: 

Please choose from the following options: 
    1 to retrieve everything from the database
    2 to get a particular entry by id
    3 to post a new tree
    4 to update an existing tree
    5 to delete an existing three
    6 to exit
